    <h3>Dogs</h3>
    <p>As always we have our rule of No dogs allowed in the shop. This is due to the chocolate and possible incidents which could occur. So, this year included, no dogs are allowed in the shop.</p>
    <h3>Chocolates</h3>
    <p>There will be free chocolates available to all our customers. Please note that due to previous experiences with certain customers, limits have had to be put in place. Here are this year's base limits:
<ul>
    <li>3 chocolates or sweets per hour per customer</li>
    <li>Customers can buy up to three more chocolates per hour with gold coins</li>
    <li>0 chocolates for dogs, they are poisonous for dogs.</li>
    <li>Other food items do not have the same strict limits right now, but limits can be added without notice in times of need</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stamp Hunt</h3>
<p>After a 1 year break due to misslayed stamps, we are very excited to share with you the return of the much-anticipated Christmas Stamp hunt. It will start and finish at the shop, and customers will get a extra free sweet for completing it. The hunt will open and close at the same times as the shop.</p>
    <h3>Internet (WiFi)</h3>
<p>We will have a WiFi network available to customers who wish to browse the internet while in the shop or check out the advertised advent calendar and Hangman game on their own device.
