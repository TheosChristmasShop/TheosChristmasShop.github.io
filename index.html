        <h1>Theo's Christmas Shop</h1>
        <p>Welcome to TCS 2025! This year we will have a stamp hunt, Hangman, an online advent calendar, card posting, internet access and much, much more. Make sure to stop by and have some fun. Find out everything you need to know below.</p>
        <h2>Resources for our customers</h2>
        <p>We have the following online Christmas-themed resources for our customers to browse and use.</p>
        <h3><a href="/hangman.html">Christmas-themed hangman</a></h3>
        <p>Based on it's extreme popularity with customers last year, we are pleased to announce the return of our Christmas-themed Hangman game! Simply click the link above to start. We warn you, though, that it isn't easy this year. Several of the words are mini-phrases (e.g. Christmas tree). Access codes will be handed out on the day, and additionally shared on our WhatsApp group.</p>
        <p>As well as on our Hangman page, you can find the current standings for the game below. Please note that being added to the list is not automatic, you need to ask us.</p>

        <p>We will have the Tactile Times online advent calendar available for browsing in the shop. Anyone can also click above to check it out beforehand if desired.</p>
        <h2>Practical information</h2>
        <p>Below you will find all the practical information you need for TCS 2025.</p>
        <h3>Opening hours</h3>
        <p>Planned to be open on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. As always our opening hours can vary greatly. We will put up a closed poster outside if we close at short notice. New for this year, you can view the shop's status online below.</p>
        <h3>Shop status</h3>
        <p>This may take up to 2 or 3 minutes to display the latest information.</p>

    <h3>Dogs</h3>
    <p>As always we have our rule of No dogs allowed in the shop. This is due to the chocolate and possible incidents which could occur. So, this year included, no dogs are allowed in the shop.</p>
    <h3>Chocolates</h3>
    <p>There will be free chocolates available to all our customers. Please note that due to previous experiences with certain customers, limits have had to be put in place. Here are this year's base limits:
<ul>
    <li>1 chocolates or sweets per hour per customer</li>
    <li>Customers can buy up to three more chocolates per hour with gold coins</li>
    <li>0 chocolates for dogs, they are poisonous for dogs.</li>
    <li> Chocolates will likely be taken away when the shop is closed. Hoarding chocolates to eat later is not allowed, unless in compliance with the rules above. If the shop is closed, you are NOT allowed to take any chocolates.</li>
    <li>Other food items do not have the same strict limits right now, but limits can be added without notice in times of need</li>
</ul>

    </p>
<h3>Stamp Hunt</h3>
<p>We are very excited to share with you the return of the much-anticipated Christmas Stamp hunt. It will start and finish at the shop, and customers will get a extra free sweet for completing it. The hunt will open and close at the same times as the shop.</p>
    <h3>Internet (WiFi)</h3>
<p>We will have a WiFi network available to customers who wish to browse the internet while in the shop or check out the advertised advent calendar and Hangman game on their own device. Please note that WiFi may be slow at times. The network is short-range, and will likely turn off outside of opening hours.</p>
