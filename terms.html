            <h1>Terms and Conditions for the TCS Hangman</h1>
            <p>By ticking the "Agree" box on the TCS Hangman page, I expressly agree that:</p>
            <p>Updated: December 2022</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I will not try and cheat</li>
                <li>I will not falsely claim a higher spot on the leaderboard when it is not mine.</li>
                <li>I will not hack the game.</li>
                <li>George is not a legend, and never will be.</li>
                <li>If I enter outside the physical shop, my entry will only be fully-verified if I screenshot the final result page.</li>
                <li>I will not share the access code with anyone outside this family</li>
                <li>I will attempt to physically visit TCS next year, on a best-efforts basis.</li>
            <li>I will return any silver or gold coins I take from the bank at TCS before the end of the calendar year.</li>
            <li>I will not enter as a team unless specified in the "Name" box (e.g. Theo and George).</li>
            <li>We can update these terms at any time, even during a round of the game. You will only agree to the most recent version if you tick the Agree box after the Terms update. This means that if we add a clause during a game, you will not automatically agree to it, however you will if you choose to play again.</li>
            <li>The game is free for anyone with the access code. Noone is allowed to sell the access code for chocolates, coins, or anything else.</li>
            <li>Theo is, and always will be, an absolute legend.</li>
            <li>Chameleon is, and always will be, an absolute legend.</li>
            <li>Noone who has helped to code any major elements of the game can compete in it. They can play but they must make it clear from their name that they are a coder and they cannot add verified entries to the leaderboard based on their games.</li>
            <li>You cannot use the Choose word function on the website to pick yourself a word to guess, that would be cheating!</li>
            <li>You cannot submit any games you took part in using words chosen by fellow players for leaderboard inclusion. Only games played using a random Christmas word are eligible for leaderboard inclusion.</li>
            <li>I will not carry more than 10 silver coins at any one time. If I find myself carrying more than 10, I must deposit the coins which fall above this threshold in the bank.</li>
            <li>Tiebreaks may occur in physical locations. In this case it is your sole responsibility to arrive at that specified location on time and ready, otherwise you may not be eligible to take part in the event.</li>
            <li>You play the game entirely at your own risk. If your computer of phone is broken as a result of excitement or anything else caused by the game, we will not be held responsible.</li>
           <li>If you have previously agreed to these terms, any clauses that you may have agreed to at that point continue to be valid, even if we later remove them from the Document for new agreements. It is your responsibility to make sure you always make copies of this document each time you agree to it.</li>
            <li>If any clause in these Terms is found to be uninforceible, the remaining clauses will continue to be valid.</li>
            <li>You are not allowed to play more than three times in the kiosk at TCS if there is a queue waiting. You can always join the back for another three tries. If there is no queue your maximum number of rounds is only limited by the time you have available, your knowledge of the access code, the computer's battery power, the reliability of the internet available in the shop and the closure of the shop.</li>
            <li>I agree that I will not break into the shop while it is closed. I may enter the room to visit the fridge or toaster or anything else, but I will not steal money or goods from the shop.</li>
            <li>I will not lock anyone in the shop.</li>
            <li>I will not be mean to Killer Rabbit.</li>
            </ol>
